            <h1>Welcome to my website !</h1>
            <p class="text-center">I created this website to train myself in
            WAMP programming. The navigation links on the top of the page are
            the Practicle Works I made with the openclassrooms course about
            making websites with PHP.<br />
            You can find this course by clicking
            <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/courses/concevez-votre-site-web-avec-php-et-mysql">
            here</a> if you are interested. It will take you less than 30 hours
            to finish it if you already have some web programming skills (you
            must be experienced in HTML5 and CSS3 though).<br />
            Please feel free to contact me if you have any
            remark/suggestion/greetings (why not?) to say, it will be a pleasure
            to discuss with you ! To that end, you can click on the mail link at
            the bottom of any page.</p><br />
            <p>Browse well ;-)</p>
